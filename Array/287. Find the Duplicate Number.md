## [287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description/)


- The main challenge is to do it without any extra space and O(N) time complexity.

- There's a famous Algorithm known for this Hare and torotoise algorithm (used to detect cycle in Linkedlist) i.e i'll be using a fast and a slow pointer to iterate the array



##### - Algorithmic Beauty

- `How ` As duplicate element is there , there'a chacnce


- `Learning` : if the values in array is in range from `1 to n` then traveral using index can be an optimal approach.




### Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        int slow = nums[0] , fast = nums[0];
        
        slow = nums[slow] , fast = nums[nums[fast]];



        // Detect cycle

        while(slow!=fast)
        {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];
        }


        // Now start from first Node
        slow = nums[0];
        

        //and move both slow and fast by 1 move
        // the point where the meet is the start of cycle or (the duplicate element)
        while(slow!=fast)
        {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[fast];
        }

        return slow;
        
    }
};
```
